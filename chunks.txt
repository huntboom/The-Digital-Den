 //Okay so I need to have the json request made, then it needs to check for books with 
  //"ebook_access": "no_ebook",
  //"has_fulltext": true,
  //"public_scan_b": true,
  //and to ONLY display titles that have text, a scan, or an ebook version. 
  //I should be able to use the api to request the cover of the book and 
  //then use that as a texture for the front of the book. 
  //Let's start simple, I want to do the following:
  //Write a component that fetches the book txt using the name of the book and the API
  //Place multiple books on the shelves
  //Get the animation for the book opening working
  //Populate the pages with the text metadata. 
  //Add the cover of the book to the texture.
  //okay let's see if from the title of a book request, I can get access to the full text:
  //GO!
    //Okay so I want title.ebooks[0]==full and then to use the 
  //Okay I can take the genre search, check if ebook_access": "public"==true and then if it is, I then make another request using the OOLID.
    //So I want my component to only display titles if they have public ebook access. 
    OkAYYYY Figured it out. I take the ia of the title, and from that I can use this https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/bookurls
    to get the first page. 

    So I make the request, example:https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=subject:mystery&limit=10 
    check if "ebook_access": "public", then if it is, I either take the first result 
    of ia[0] as my identifier, 
    or preferably "lending_identifier_s": "widowlerougenove00gabo", and use that
    https://archive.org/download/{identifier}#page/title
    to get the cover of the book I want.
